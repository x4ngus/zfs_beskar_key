# ZFS Beskar Key

<img width="860" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/309192cc-9f2b-42ac-b36a-918083e472ef" />

## Background

The goal was clear: create a **reliable and safe** method to auto-unlock ZFS-on-root using a USB key, without ever sacrificing the fallback passphrase or bricking the system.

Bash failed.  

Systemd units fought the boot order. So this was reforged in **Rust**, with precision and patience — just as the Armorer would demand.

---

## Purpose

ZFS Beskar Key automates secure USB-based key unlock for **ZFS-on-root systems** using **Dracut**. It ensures your encrypted pool can unlock automatically from a removable USB key, while still allowing manual passphrase unlock if the key is missing.

---

## What It Does

1. **Generates a 32-byte raw ZFS key** and binds it to `rpool` **without** removing your passphrase.
2. **Detects removable USB partitions** via `lsblk -J` + `udevadm`; you select from a **numbered list** (no typing `/dev/*`).
3. **Formats and labels** the selected device as **`BESKARKEY`** (ext4) and copies **`holocron.key`** to its root.
4. **Installs a persistent Dracut module** at `/etc/dracut/modules.d/90zfs-usbkey` that:
   - Waits for USB enumeration (udev trigger + settle, with retries),
   - Mounts the key device by label,
   - Loads keys and imports `rpool` pre-mount.
5. **Rebuilds initramfs** and **verifies** the hook is embedded (using `lsinitrd`).
6. **Runs a non-invasive self-test** using a 1 MiB file-vdev pool to validate both **keyfile** and **passphrase** unlock paths.

---

## Dependencies

Ubuntu **25.10** (ZFS-on-root) or equivalent.

System packages:
```
bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y zfsutils-linux dracut-core lsblk udev mkfs.ext4
```

**Rust toolchain (≥ 1.75):**
```
bash
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

## Trials in the Forge

Lessons learned from the failed attempts that shaped this tool:

* **USB enumeration** can lag in initramfs; a hard 10 s wait is not enough. The hook now **triggers udev** and **waits up to 30 s** with retries.
* **Pre-importing pools** before keys load causes silent failure paths. The hook loads the key, **then** imports `rpool` with `-N`.
* **Child dataset inheritance** can drift (e.g., `rpool/ROOT/ubuntu_*`). The tool **converges encryption roots** back to `rpool`, then verifies none remain independent.
* **Fallback must be sacred.** After attaching the raw key, the tool explicitly resets `keylocation=prompt` so passphrase unlock always works.

This project survived multiple real rebuilds of Ubuntu 25.10 and initramfs recovery drills, until the boot path behaved predictably with and without the USB key.

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/x4ngus/zfs_beskar_key.git
cd zfs_beskar_key
cargo build --release
```

---

## Run

Run with privileges (formatting, mounting, dracut, and ZFS operations require sudo):

```bash
sudo ./target/release/zfs_beskar_key
```

You’ll see clear, themed steps:

* Forging beskar ingot — generating ZFS key
* Tempering the forge — detecting removable USB partitions
* Binding the clans — formatting USB and copying key
* Etching runes — installing Dracut hook & rebuilding initramfs
* Testing the forge — verifying keyfile & passphrase unlock

A single red **blaster bar** animates progress across the bottom of the terminal.

## Verify

Pool bindings (post-setup):

```bash
zfs get keyformat,keylocation,keystatus rpool
```

Expected:

```
rpool  keyformat    raw
rpool  keylocation  prompt
rpool  keystatus    available
```

Hook embedded:

```bash
lsinitrd | grep zfs-usb-key.sh
```

USB by label:

```bash
sudo blkid -L BESKARKEY
```

---

## Uninstall / Rollback

Remove the Dracut module and rebuild:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/dracut/modules.d/90zfs-usbkey
sudo dracut --force
```

Passphrase unlock remains available by design.
